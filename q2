Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

1.Objects representation in javascript.
   * The most important data - type and forms the building block for      modern java script.
   * Object are quite different from java script's primitive data - type in the sense that while this primitive data types all store a single value .
   * It is more complex and each object may contain any combination of this primitive date type .
   * It is a reffernce date type. 
   * It can be created with brackets { } with an optional list of properties. 

2. Internal representation in java script 
    * The java script standard allows developers to define objects in a very flexible way.
    * It  is hard to come up with an efficient representation that work for everything .
    * Object is essentially a collection of properties. 
    * Property names are always strings .
    * If we use a name that is not a strings. It is immplicity converted to a strings. so the object is basically a map from string to values
